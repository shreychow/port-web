      <h1>Hello, world!!! I'm Shreyosee</h1>
      <p class="bio">Hi, I’m Shreyosee Chowdhury! 👩‍💻
      I’m a Computer Science major at the Grove School of Engineering at CCNY, with a strong passion for web development and artificial intelligence. I love building meaningful tech and exploring how code can be used to create impact.

      This summer, I’ll be starting as a Fellow in Break Through Tech’s AI Program (2025–26),an exciting step in my journey to deepen my skills in machine learning and real-world AI applications.

      Outside the classroom, I proudly serve as a Superuser at the Makerspace, where I train others on creative tools and technologies. I’m also the upcoming Secretary for the Society of Women Engineers (2025–26),a role I’m excited to take on as I continue empowering and learning from fellow women in STEM.

      I’m someone who loves connecting with people and hearing their stories.It inspires me to grow and see the world from new perspectives.

      Fun fact: When I’m not coding,I enjoy photography and baking.

      Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to explore my passions!</p>
